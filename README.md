# command_mech

I started making this giant robot while I was in phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp to get comfortable with making classes, modules, and single-responsibility methods. This exists purely for fun and a place for me to practice object oriented project.

There is nothing serious about this project. Feel free to contribute. Make a mech out of whatever the hell you want.

I want to make a Ruby-based Mech (installed via gem), a Javascript-based Mech (node package or something like that), and I dunno, a C-based mech (some straight up GNU/UNIX type jam?).

A Mech should be made out of at least 5 components using Classes. Maybe there should be a basic Component class.

A Mech can also have weapon or tool Modules. You'd use a module to add a badass plasma sword or digging tools, or I don't know generate project skeletons.

From the command line, you should be able to say "activate mech" and then get access to a menu with options "mission", "mods", "check Component".

Thinking "mission" could be some sort of choose-your-own-adventure game.
